A small orchestration service that coordinates certificate lifecycle events across internal services. The goal was to replace ad-hoc manual renewals with a predictable, audited pipeline.

## Impact
- Reduced certificate renewal toil from hours to minutes per month.
- Standardized rotation windows across 40+ services.
- Added audit trails for compliance reviews.

## Lessons learned
- Clear ownership is as important as the automation itself.
- Rotation safety depends on pre-flight checks and rapid rollback.
- Certificate issuance needs to be observable, not just automated.

## Stack
- HashiCorp Vault PKI
- GitOps workflows with policy checks
- Prometheus alerts + Slack notifications
