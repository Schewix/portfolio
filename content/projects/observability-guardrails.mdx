A platform initiative to standardize metrics, logging, and tracing across multiple service stacks. The project introduced opinionated defaults and a lightweight review process.

## Impact
- Reduced mean time to detect by ~30% for critical services.
- Cut onboarding time for new services by providing a telemetry starter kit.
- Enabled cross-service correlation with consistent trace IDs.

## Lessons learned
- Defaults win: teams adopt standards faster when it is the easiest option.
- Telemetry needs product thinking and clear success metrics.
- Documentation matters as much as instrumentation.

## Stack
- OpenTelemetry collectors
- Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- Loki log aggregation with structured logging
