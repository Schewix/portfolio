summary: "A pragmatic checklist that prevents the most common certificate rotation failures."
---

PKI incidents are rarely about the crypto. They are about timing, ownership, and missing validation. This checklist is meant to be copy-pasted into your runbook.

## Inventory the dependencies
List every service that consumes the certificate. Include cron jobs, sidecars, and internal clients.

## Dry-run the renewal
Use a staging environment to validate the renewal flow end-to-end. Confirm that the certificate chain is correct.

## Alert on expiration windows
Create a dashboard showing the next 30/14/7 day expirations. Pair it with an alert for 14 days.

## Validate after rollout
Check the full chain of trust and any clients that pin certificates.
