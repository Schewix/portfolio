When teams grow, toil becomes invisible. Not because it disappears, but because it spreads across people and timezones. This note captures a lightweight system for tracking it.

## Define the buckets
Start with 4 categories that map to your real work:

- Break/fix work
- Repetitive operations
- Onboarding and knowledge transfer
- Reactive support

## Capture signals, not perfect data
Don’t ask for detailed spreadsheets. Ask for a weekly 60-second check-in: “What’s the biggest thing you repeated?” That is often enough to justify automation.

## Convert the data into action
If a task shows up 3 weeks in a row, it’s a candidate for a small automation sprint.

Treat toil like a product backlog: collect, triage, and ship small wins.

## Follow-up loop
Review the list monthly with the team and celebrate removals. It keeps momentum.
