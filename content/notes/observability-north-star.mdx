A dashboard is only useful if it answers a question quickly. When teams start from dashboards, they miss the real operational context.

## Start with the questions
Ask “What could wake us up at 3am?” or “How do we know this release is safe?” The dashboard is a visual answer, not the starting point.

## Create a minimal telemetry contract
Every service should emit:

- A request counter with status codes
- A latency histogram
- A saturation signal (queue depth, CPU, or worker backlog)

## Build feedback loops
Review every incident and ask: which question was missing? That question becomes a new panel or alert.
